Fakebook-Crawler
================

For this crawler, we realized that there would be four major pieces to develop:
we had to implement some basic features of the HTTP protocol, reverse engineer
the login system, perform a breadth-first-search of the network, and parse each
page for links and secret keys. With three of us in the group, the work was
easily compartmentalized and shared.

Reverse engineering the login system proved to be the most complicated part - we
failed to recognize that the cookies sent when the login page was retrieved were
replaced upon successful login. After we realized that the 302 redirect also
contained a new cookie, the rest of our code worked with few changes.

We tested our code mostly through trial and error, stepping through functions
with PDB to isolate any bugs. We also made many manual HTTP requests using a
Chrome plugin, and used the Chrome inspector to understand the login process.
